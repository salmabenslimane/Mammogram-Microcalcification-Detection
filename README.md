# Mammogram-Microcalcification-Detection
## About 
This repository contains code and resources for the detection of microcalcifications in mammography images using machine learning models. The project aims to develop and compare the performance of k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest models for microcalcification classification.
## Dataset
The project utilizes an imbalanced dataset specifically designed for microcalcification detection in mammography images. The dataset, which can be found in the repository, mimics the real-world scenario, where microcalcifications are relatively rare compared to non-microcalcification areas in mammograms. The imbalanced dataset poses unique challenges for model training and evaluation, requiring the implementation of appropriate techniques to handle class imbalance, such as oversampling, undersampling, or the use of specialized algorithms. The dataset provides an opportunity to develop and evaluate machine learning models that can effectively address the imbalanced nature of microcalcification detection tasks.
To address this class imbalance, different techniques have been applied for the various machine learning models. For the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) model, oversampling techniques were employed to balance the data by generating synthetic examples of the minority class. On the other hand, the support vector machine (SVM) and random forest models utilized cost-sensitive learning techniques, where the class imbalance is handled by assigning different misclassification costs to the minority and majority classes during training. This allows the models to account for the imbalanced nature of the microcalcification detection task effectively. The dataset provides a valuable resource for developing and evaluating machine learning models that address the challenges posed by imbalanced data in microcalcification detection.
