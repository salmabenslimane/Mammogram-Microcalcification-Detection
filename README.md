# Mammogram-Microcalcification-Detection
This repository contains code and resources for the detection of microcalcifications in mammography images using machine learning models. The project aims to develop and compare the performance of k-nearest neighbors (k-NN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest models for microcalcification classification.
